# New York City Citibike Analysis

## Overview

In New York City, Citibike has improved how locals and visitors get around the city.  Wanting to apply that program in Des Moines, an analysis of the NYC bike share program will help understand how successful it could be locally. Using Tableau, gender, trip duration, and day of the week are broken down to give a visual representation of the data.

## Summary

The central business for Citibike is the subscription service, which we assume is the commuters.  The tourist or the longer rentals are not as popular in NYC.  Depending on Des Moines population and commuter routes, this could be a great alternative.
